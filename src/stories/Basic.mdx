# Getting Started

## Common Layouts

With `zoom-tabs`, you have the power to layout your content however you want. But it is very common
to layout content so that thumbnail previews are on one side and the selected content is front and
center. For this reason, the `<Sidebar>` component is provided. It takes care of the layout behind
the scenes so that you only need to specify the collection of elements to be shown.

Consider the following simple fragment of TSX code:

```jsx
<ZoomProvider>
  <Sidebar aspectRatio={1.6}>
    <p>Sample content 1</p>
    <p>Sample content 2</p>
    <p>Sample content 3</p>
  </Sidebar>
</ZoomProvider>
```

For this case, we've styled the `<Sidebar>` element with a black border and each
individual child of the sidebar with a red border to better demonstrate how the
layout and transitions are handled...

<Canvas of={BasicStories.BasicExample} />

## Bring Your Own Layout

Although the `<Sidebar>` component represents common use cases, it is possible
to use nearly any layout you can come up with. The key is to enclose a portion
of your UI with `<ZoomProvider>` and then, within that tree include `<ZoomSlot>`
elements to wrap the different views you want to switch between and an instance
of `<ZoomOutlet>` in the space where you want to view the full version.

So, for example, we could use CSS Grids to describe a layout. Using the following
CSS:

```css
.parent {
  display: grid;
  aspect-ratio: 1.6;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(5, 1fr);
  grid-column-gap: 0px;
  grid-row-gap: 0px;
}

.div1 {
  grid-area: 1 / 1 / 2 / 2;
  aspect-ratio: 1.6;
}
.div2 {
  grid-area: 5 / 5 / 6 / 6;
  aspect-ratio: 1.6;
}
.div3 {
  grid-area: 5 / 1 / 6 / 2;
  aspect-ratio: 1.6;
}
.div4 {
  grid-area: 1 / 5 / 2 / 6;
  aspect-ratio: 1.6;
}
.div5 {
  grid-area: 2 / 2 / 5 / 5;
  aspect-ratio: 1.6;
}
```

Then we can create a simple layout using:

```jsx
<ZoomProvider>
  <div className="parent">
    <div className="div1">
      <ZoomSlot slot="ul">Upper Left</ZoomSlot>
    </div>
    <div className="div2">
      <ZoomSlot slot="lr">Lower Right</ZoomSlot>
    </div>
    <div className="div3">
      <ZoomSlot slot="ll">Lower Left</ZoomSlot>
    </div>
    <div className="div4">
      <ZoomSlot slot="ur">Upper Right</ZoomSlot>
    </div>
    <div className="div5">
      <ZoomOutlet />
    </div>
  </div>
</ZoomProvider>
```

<Canvas of={BasicStories.BasicGridExample} />
