With `zoom-tabs`, you have the power to layout your content however you want. But it is very common
to layout content so that thumbnail previews are on one side and the selected content is front and
center. For this reason, the `<Sidebar>` component is provided. It takes care of the layout behind
the scenes so that you only need to specify the collection of elements to be shown.

Consider the following simple fragment of TSX code:

```typescript
<ZoomProvider>
  <Sidebar aspectRatio={1.6}>
    <p>Sample content 1</p>
    <p>Sample content 2</p>
    <p>Sample content 3</p>
  </Sidebar>
</ZoomProvider>
```

For this case, we've styled the `<Sidebar>` element with a black border and each
individual child of the sidebar with a red border to better demonstrate how the
layout and transitions are handled...

<Canvas of={BasicStories.BasicExample} />
