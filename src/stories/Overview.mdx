    # Zoom Tabs Overview

    The goal of this UI element is to allow switching between different "pages" of content.  But unlike
    conventional tabs which include some kind of tab with a title or perhaps an icon to help users navigate
    between the different pages of content, the tabs here include a full view of the content of the tab but
    scaled into a small thumbnail preview.

    ## Layout

    One of the nice things about this package is that it allows you to determine how all the various thumbnails
    and the content "outlet" are laid out.  This package simply takes care of the graphical transitions that
    occur when the individual pages are selected.
