    # Zoom Tabs Overview

    The goal of this UI element is to allow switching between different "pages" of content.  But unlike
    conventional tabs which include some kind of tab with a title or perhaps an icon to help users navigate
    between the different pages of content, the tabs here include a full view of the content of the tab but
    scaled into a small thumbnail preview.

    ## Layout

    One of the nice things about this package is that it allows you to determine how all the various thumbnails
    and the content "outlet" are laid out.  This package simply takes care of the graphical transitions that
    occur when the individual pages are selected.

    This package can be used with any layout of a page.  All the user has to do is add a `<ZoomSlot>` component
    anywhere they would like to see a thumbnail preview.  The children of the `<ZoomSlot>` will be the contents
    associated with that slot.  In addition, a `<ZoomOutlet>` component needs to be placed somewhere in the UI
    where the non-thumbnail version of the content is to be shown.

    ### `<Sidebar>` Layout

    Because it is very common to want thumbnails lined up along one edge and the "outlet" placed next to them,
    the `<Sidebar>` component is provided.  The children of the `<Sidebar>` are the content to be shown in the
    thumbnails and/or outlet.  Using the `<Sidebar>` takes care of all layout, the user just provides the
    content, _e.g.,_

    ```typescript
    <ZoomProvider>
      <Sidebar aspectRatio={1.6}>
        <p>Sample content 1</p>
        <p>Sample content 2</p>
        <p>Sample content 3</p>
      </Sidebar>
    </ZoomProvider>
    ```
