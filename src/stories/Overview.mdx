    # Zoom Tabs Overview

    The goal of this UI element is to allow switching between different "pages" of content.  But unlike
    conventional tabs which include some kind of tab with a title or perhaps an icon to help users navigate
    between the different pages of content, the tabs here include a full view of the content of the tab but
    scaled into a small thumbnail preview.

    Here are various topics demonstrated in this Storybook:

    1. [Common layout patterns](/docs/stories-basic--docs#common-layouts)
    2. [Selecting thumbnail edge](/docs/stories-using-overlays--docs#picking-a-side)
    3. [Using your own layout](/docs/stories-basic--docs#bring-your-own-layout)
    4. [Controlling slot expansion](/docs/stories-initially-open-slots--docs#initially-open-content)
    5. [Adding overlays](/docs/stories-using-overlays--docs#basic-overlays)
    6. [Higher order components](/docs/stories-using-overlays--docs#picking-a-size)
    7. [Controlling sidebar size](/docs/stories-initially-open-slots--docs#padding-thumbnails)
