# Initially Open Content

When configuring a `<ZoomProvider>`, it is possible to specify that a particular
slot should be open initially, _e.g._,

```jsx
<ZoomProvider initiallyOpen="slot0">...</ZoomProvider>
```

This can be used, for example, to provide some instructions and orientation to
users.

<Canvas of={OpenStories.InitiallyOpen} />

Note that in this example the initial slot includes buttons that allow us to
control the transitions with UI elements (in addition to the "automatic" click
handlers already provided by `<ZoomSlot>` components). This is accomplished
with code like this:

```typescript
export const Introduction = () => {
  const { controls } = React.useContext(zoomContext);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Keeping an Eye on Content</h1>
      <div>...</div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => controls.expandSlot("slot1")}>
          Kobe's Final Game
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => controls.expandSlot("slot2")}>
          L.A. Lakers vs. Sacramento Kings
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => controls.expandSlot("slot3")}>
          Last 6 Minutes of Bucks vs. Suns
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => controls.expandSlot("slot4")}>
          Michael Jordan's Final Bull's Game
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Padding Thumbnails

Note that it is possible with `<Sidebar>` to put the thumbnails on any edge of
the `<div>`. So, for example, we can put them across the top. Another thing we
can do is specify a minimum number of thumbnails.

The following attributes were used to create this variation:

```jsx
<Sidebar minSlots={7} side="right">
  ...
</Sidebar>
```

This is useful because with fewer thumbnails, the aspect ratio constraints will
tend make the thumbnails larger unless we add some extra "empty" space. The
following example demonstrates both putting the thumbnails at the top as well as
adding extra "blank" space among the thumbnails:

<Canvas of={OpenStories.NestedVideosOnTopSevenSlots} />
