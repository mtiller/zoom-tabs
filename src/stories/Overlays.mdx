# Adding Overlays

## Basic Overlays

When content resumes its thumbnail position, it is possible to provide an
"overlay" component that provides some additional contextual information. This
useful when the content itself becomes hard to read because of the scaling and
the overlay can be used to summarize information in the visual that can no
longer be easily read.

This is done by leveraging the `<SlotContent>` component. This component allows
for specifying **both** the content of the thumbnail (which is placed as the
child of the `<SlotContent`>) and an "overlay" component using the `overlay`
attribute. For example,

```jsx
<SlotContent overlay={<h1>Bar Chart</h1>}>
  {(size) => (
    <Vega
      width={size.width}
      height={size.height}
      ...
    />
  )}
</SlotContent>
```

Using the `<SlotContent>` component we can achieve visuals like this:

<Canvas of={OverlaysStories.WithOverlay} />

## Picking a Size

Note that the "child" in the previous example is actually a closure. Both `<ZoomSlot>` and `<SlotContent>` allow
their children to be higher order components. This is very useful when you have content that isn't not
particularly "responsive". Because the size information is passed in in this case, we can automatically size
the content in the slot to fit.

## Picking a Side

As mentioned previously, it is possible to place the thumbnails along any edge. For example,
in this case (with only the change of the `side` attribute), we can place the thumbnails
on the right:

<Canvas of={OverlaysStories.WithOverlayRight} />

## Interactions

Note that when "tucked away", the thumbnails cannot be interacted with. The
only interaction allowed is to click on the thumbnail to zoom in or out of that
particular slot. But when not scaled down to a thumbnail, you are free to
interact with the content in all the normal ways.
